Hello! Welcome to the Blog. 

It most certainly has been a while since my last post onto this site. I totally have forgotten about this project while pursuing other wavelengths. But, I've gotten the itch to get back track and regularly commit to share my findings and my views about the world around me. 

Stay tuned to the following posts:
- My December 2023 California International Marathon experience
- My March 2024 The Speed Project LALV experience with the Asian Trail Mix TSP team (https://www.instagram.com/atmxtsp[https://www.instagram.com/atmxtsp])
- My May 2024 Trip to Japan. I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, and Yokohama. 
- My June 2024 Brooklyn Queens Brewery Express Half-marathon experience.
- My initial thoughts about diving into the world of Reddit Collectible Avatars and Reddit Community Currencies.
- My experience and reasons why I have exited completely out of the Loopring Ecosystem.
