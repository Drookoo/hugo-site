## Introduction - Pre Run
I attended the Asian Trail Mix July Beach Run at Orchard Beach in the Bronx on Sunday, July 9. It was a morning event, so I had to wake up super early in order to get to the start on time. For this month's Asian Trail Mix run, that involved me opening up the shipping box that my Salomon Pulsar Trail Pros came in, putting them on for the first time and then taking the tags off my new Salomon Adv Skin 12. For pre-run breakfast fuel, I had three donuts from Dunkin' and a SIS energy Gel.  

Getting to the event revolved around getting on the uptown D train then getting on the Bx12 bus to Orchard Beach. I unfortunately did not know that the Bx12 lines diverge, and some buses will take you to the Bay Plaza Mall as opposed to where I wanted to go: Orchard Beach. So my commute included a quick short Lyft Ride to where I actually wanted to go.  

## The Trail Run
There were four pace groups with varying paces. I was floating around because I was taking stills for the event. I appreciated the wide path and the scenic route from the woodlands, to the marsh, and then to the beach. There were little crabs hanging out on the sand in the marsh and the look-out points had some locals lounging around that add to the Bronx sparkle. 

## Post Run - Amenities
There was water, Guacamole 


## Final thoughts
I really enjoyed running in the Salomon Pulsar Trail Pro. The running vest with hydration flasks definitely help. I wish I remembered to flush them out thoroughly because I could very much taste the new bottle taste while I was getting through the bottle.
