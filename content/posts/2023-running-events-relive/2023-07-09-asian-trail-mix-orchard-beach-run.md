## Introduction - Pre Run
I attended the Asian Trail Mix July Beach Run at Orchard Beach in the Bronx on Sunday, July 9. It was a morning event, so I had to wake up super early in order to get to the start on time. For this month's Asian Trail Mix run, that involved me opening up the shipping box that my Salomon Pulsar Trail Pros came in, putting them on for the first time and then taking the tags off my new Salomon Adv Skin 12. For pre-run breakfast fuel, I had three donuts from Dunkin' and a SIS energy Gel.  

Getting to the event revolved around getting on the uptown D train then getting on the Bx12 bus to Orchard Beach. I unfortunately did not know that the Bx12 lines diverge, and some buses will take you to the Bay Plaza Mall as opposed to where I wanted to go: Orchard Beach. So my commute included a quick short Lyft Ride to where I actually wanted to go.  

## The Trail Run
There were four pace groups with varying paces. The route starts off as paved asphalt to woodland trail, to a marshy beach with stepping stones, to sandy beach back to paved asphalt and concrete. The route was very scenic and fairly wide. Plus there were little crabs hanging out, and burrowing in the sand and the look-out points had some locals lounging around that add to the elusive Bronx-certified sparkle. 

## Post Run - Amenities
There was water, hand churned guacamole, frozen ice pops, and fizzy drinks for refreshments. Arc'teryx had a merchandise raffle and everyone took home a hat or a visor, and some merino wool socks. There was a small batch of Supergoop sunscreen and Cheribundi tart cherry juice.


## Final thoughts
I really enjoyed running in the Salomon Pulsar Trail Pro. The running vest with hydration flasks definitely helps. I wish I remembered to flush the flasks out thoroughly because I could very much taste the new bottle taste while I was sipping water on the run. I've never ran on sand before, and I really enjoy running on wet sand. Not so much on dry sand though. The trails could have been more maintained by the parks department and I really enjoyed how the bus stop at Orchard Beach was the last one, so you knew exactly when the bus was going to come.
