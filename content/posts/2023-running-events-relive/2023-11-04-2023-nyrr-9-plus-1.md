## Introduction
This year is my first time completing the 2023 NYRR 9 + 1 for the 2024 NYC Marathon Guaranteed Entry Program. Today was the conclusion of my

## Volunteer Entry 1: RBC Brooklyn Half Marathon

## Race 1: Queens 10K 

## Race 2: FRNY LGBT Pride Run 4M
This was my first race inside Central Park. I started in Corral C. There was misting that turned to a light rain. Got a cool rainbow bagel, and wish I got a popsicle too. I had a SIS energy bar before the race, and I was happy that my apce was more or less aligned with my pace that I acheived in the Queens 10K. (~7:20 minutes / mile or so. )

## Race 3: Achilles 4M
This day I slept for about 11 hours before the 8:15 AM start. This meant that I skipped dinner so 30 minutes before thee race, I was flipping a cheesburger, and it was inside my body 15 minutes soon after. Not going to lie, it was a hot and humid race. I defeinately should've eaten. 

## Race 4: Retro 4M

## Race 5: Percy Sutton Harlem 5K

## Race 6: New York City Marathon Training Series 12M

## Race 7: Grete's Great Gallop 10K

## Race 8: New York City Marathon Training Series 18M

## Race 9: Dash to the Finish Line 5K

## Closing Thoughts
Definately some of the races are too hot to run. If I choose to do the 9+1 program again next year, I would get my volunetter opportunity in ASAP. I would also use the virtual races to my advantage.
