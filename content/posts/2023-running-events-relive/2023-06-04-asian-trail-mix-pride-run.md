## Introduction - Pre Run
I attended the Asian Trail Mix June Pride Run at the Tenafly Nature Center in New Jersey on Sunday, June 04. It took place in the afternoon, so it allowed plenty of time to get from where I am based to the trail head. For fuel before I got on the NJ Transit Bus, my first time on it, I had a sandwich and sweet potato fries from Schnipper's. This time I bough water with me, which came in handy. I was very eager for this run because I was hoping that I would be a recipient of some new shoes: the new Altra Torin 7s. It happened to be every one else's lucky day for everyone that signed up for the shoe raffle got shoes as well. Cheers to those that filled out the raffle, but had a last minute conflict. 

The Altra Torin 7s were zero drop shoes that means that your sole stays perpendicular to the ground when standing still. Some runners can't run in them, while some swear by them. But my biggest regret was wearing them for the first time, then going on a five mile trail run that I have never ran before. 

## The Trail Run
There were three pace groups. I opted to run in the fastest one, kudos to the pack leader Seb for navigating the trail while also checking the route on strava. It was pretty much single file running with little room to overtake more than 2 people in front of you. There were obstacles to dodge on your feet and also for your head. It was a long four miles that had one stop close to the end of the route, and one where we had a photo op at the very end.

## Post Run - Ammenities
Culture Pop, and Nantucket crisps bought the goods to the event. I've realized that the superior culture pop flavor is Lemon Lime. Every other one pales in comparison. I had a few crisps, but I was not a big fan of how savory they were. 


## Heading Home
It was a 20 minute trek, albiet downhill, back to Tenafly to catch the bus. We were able to catch a ride with some event attendees and gave them directions to town where we got off the bus. It was a long bus ride home with a lot of passengers boarding, offboarding, and onboarding. As usual, the roadways into Manhattan from Jersey were congested. 


## Final thoughts
A very fun run. I should have known that with new shoes I should definately not keep them factory laced for my first run. I felt like I wasn't very stable because of the loose laces.
