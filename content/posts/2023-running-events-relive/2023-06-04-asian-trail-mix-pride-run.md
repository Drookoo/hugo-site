## Introduction - Pre Run
I attended the Asian Trail Mix June Pride Run at the Tenafly Nature Center in New Jersey on Sunday, June 04. It took place in the afternoon, so it allowed plenty of time to get from where I am based to the trail head. For fuel before I got on the NJ Transit Bus, my first time on it, I had a sandwich and sweet potato fries from Schnipper's. This time I bought water with me, which came in handy. I was very eager for this run because I was hoping that I would be a recipient of some new shoes: the new Altra Torin 7s. It happened to be every one else's lucky day for everyone that signed up for the shoe raffle got shoes as well. Cheers to those that filled out the raffle, but had a last minute conflict. 

The Altra Torin 7s were zero drop shoes that means that your sole stays perpendicular to the ground when standing still. Some runners can't run in them, while some swear by them. But my biggest regret was wearing them for the first time, then going on a five-mile trail run that I have never run before. 

## The Trail Run
There were three pace groups. I opted to run in the fastest one, kudos to the pack leader Seb for navigating the trail while also checking the route on Strava. It was pretty much single file running with little room to overtake more than 2 people in front of you. There were obstacles to dodge on your feet and also for your head. Some folks in my pace group tripped over trail hazards and fell, so there were a few scrapes here and there. It was a lengthy four miles that and our pace group only stopped once for. 

## Post Run - Amenities
Culture Pop, and Nantucket Crisps bought the goods to the event. I've realized that my perceived superior culture pop flavor is Lemon Lime. All the other flavors pale in comparison. I had a few chips, but I was not a big fan of how savory they were. The community brought out sliced watermelon for all which was very nice to enjoy.


## Heading Home
It was a twenty-minute trek, albeit downhill, back to Tenafly to catch the bus. We were able to catch a ride with some other event attendees and gave them the directions back to town where we got off the bus from Port Authority. It was a painstakingly long bus ride home with a lot of passengers boarding and off boarding. As usual, the roadways into Manhattan from Jersey were congested, so knowing that home was about 30 minutes away on a good day made the post adventure shower and nap much more to be desired.


## Final thoughts
The run was super fun, and I had a great time. I should have known that wearing new shoes, especially ones that are zero-drop, to a trail run that I did not do any homework on is a recipe for disaster. I scuffed the outsole against the trail terrain multiple times, and I was glad to change back to the trainers that I wore getting there. The next time I end up at Tenafly, I'll be sure to stop by the nature center where they take care of the resident birds, reptiles, and furry mammals.
