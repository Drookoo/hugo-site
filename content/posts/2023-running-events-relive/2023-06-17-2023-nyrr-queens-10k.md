## Introduction
On Saturday June 17, I ran the Queens 10K in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. This race holds incredible meaning to me for a few reasons: it was my first New York Road Runners race that qualifies for the 9+1 guaranteed entry program for next year's New York City Marathon, it was my first chip timed race, and most importantly the event takes place in Queens, my home borough, and not too far from wher I grew up. The running conditions for that day were very optimal for running with partly cloudy skies with a slight breeze. My seeded corral was in the first wave, corral E. So, I got to start relatively sooner than half of the event participants, and a whole lot of headroom to make way.

My only goal was to finish under 48 minutes. 

## Race Day
There is a saying called `Nothing new on race day`. That was not the case for me. I wore a singlet for the first time. I'm a short sleeve person rain or shine all the time. But for this event, I was prod to rep Run For Chinatown. Huge thanks to the major players on getting my threads in my hands in time for the Race Day. 

There was a a group photo spot. It took me forever to find the group photo spot. Mainly because I didn't look at the course map at all till I physically got the event. While in the corrals, the announcers announced that the course was fairly technical with a couple of climbs and potholes. I found out real quick that in order to overtake, I had to run off asphalt onto the curb and grassy, rooting sections to push ahead. I made a lot of dangerous maneuvers, threading through pairs, tailgating until I found an opportunity, etc. 

I made a grave mistake near the end where I decided that I should get some water for the first time. Bad idea, I only had a sip while running and tossed the remaining.





Now onto next week's races: Pride 4M and Achilles International 4M. Both will be in central park.
