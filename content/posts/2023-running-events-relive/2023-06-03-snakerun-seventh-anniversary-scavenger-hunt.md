## The Background
This was my second ever [Snake Run](https://www.instagram.com/snakerunnyc/) event. The first being the previous monthly one in May which went hit up many art galleries in Chelsea and the West Village. I was very excited about this event because the organizers hyped it up a month prior, and they did not disappoint when that day arrived. For those not in the know, the whole point of Snake Run is to run and see art via checkpoints on the route. This idea when I first stumbled upon it was extremely cool to me, plus art is always very cool. 

## The Meet Spot
The meet spot was in Soho @ 182 Broadway. There didn't seem like there was a store occupying the space, but there were tables, chairs, and sofas that reminded me of some kind of Coffee shop or Caf√©. There was a DJ Spinning Vinyl, a bag drop, and wide indoor spaces to connect. The coolest thing I looked forward to was how Lululemon supported the event, and I was rewarded with a cool printed shirt on the Lululemon Fundamental T. The event posting told us to make teams in advance, but me being me, was fine with forming an ad hoc team. 

## The Down Low
As the teams spilled onto the street after formation for group photos, I kind of pieced together the structure of the scavenger hunt. Points of interest are set in advanced but are revealed to everyone at once, and you and your team need to take a group photo at the mandatory two specific pieces, and then four more pieces of your team's choosing out of six. The first team back at the meet spot wins. Plus there was a bonus prize where if you were the first one to send a selfie of a specific piece, you were given an entry to the Brooklyn Queens Brewery Express Half Marathon that takes place the following weekend. 

## Team Strategy
My team did bean, then the pier, then black and white, then starbucks, then... space invader, then nipple bert. nipple bert was actually covered up by another piece days before.
