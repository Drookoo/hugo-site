## Introduction
Run for Chinatown just hosted its first track meet at the Murry Bergtraum Softball Field and Track. For those unaware, there is an outdoor running track in Chinatown that is not the East River Park track. The track has views of the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge and the greenway along South street. Though the Softball Field and Track are attachments to the High School with its namesake, it is not accessible to the public outside of events like these. Great job for the Run For Chinatown team to pull this together!

There was a big turnout from the Asian American Pacific Islander community, local run clubs, athletic clubs, as well as youth that are a part of the athletic programs in the public school system. The check in process was very smooth, and the venue was very well maintained. There was plenty of water jugs to ensure that hydration was available under the unrelenting sun, and everyone received a drawstring bag to commemorate the event. The track meet started with introductions and a pep talk, followed by a lion dance performance and display, and finally the races.

## How I did
I ran every event, the 1500 m, 300-meter and the 4 x 300-meter team relay. I thought that hey, I paid for it, so I might as well run every event. 
At the end my 1500 m time was 05:40. My 300-meter time was 48 seconds, and my team relay 300-meter time was 50 seconds. I consider this a success, even though I have never ran on a track prior to the day before.

Looking back, I made a couple of core mistakes:
- I did not apply sunscreen to the back of my neck. I regrettably wish that I had done while I'm typing this post up.
- I should have tried to time my best minute mile as well as my best 300-meter time. I thought I could run with the wolves, but I ended up at the back of the pack. 
- I should have warmed up and hydrated more before my first event (the 1500 meter). I was well winded after I crossed the line.

## Wrapping Up
Shout out to Run For Chinatown, Central Park Running Club, and Sunset Park Prep Patriot for being good sports on our last-minute ad-hoc relay team. 

Bonus event: Mia and I saw a very majestic Husky/ Samoyed running with no leash while we were leaving the track to go to Big Wong's for lunch. On a perpendicular corner we soon saw a woman running with a leash in her hands that definitely looked like she was in no shape to chase. Once we confirmed that she was trying to catch the dog, I sprinted up to try to follow it and wrangle it up. I lost track of the dog at the busy East Broadway and Market Street Corner, but quickly found the dog trying to steal a snack from a herbal, dry goods vendor stand under the Manhattan Bridge. A second success of the day.
