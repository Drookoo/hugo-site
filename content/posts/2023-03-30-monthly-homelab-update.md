# Some notable things from this month:
- Deployed new services: a zine reader, and a Flickr alternative! 
- Realized that the ethernet port on my personal portable machine had a fast ethernet network card. Data transfer speeds were slower over the wire as opposed to wireless. No fear, there is already a dedicated windows box that was set up last week that can carry the burden. The personal portable machine can remain as a jump box. 
- Realized that WSL is not it for sshing onto my boxes. PuTTy is the vibe.
- Built a new dedicated box. An AM4 5900x, RTX 4070Ti, 32 GB DDR4, micro-ATX build! Some issues arose during installation mainly because AIO coolers are new to me, and weird RAM timings and dual channel incompatibilities. But most as of this month have been resolved.
