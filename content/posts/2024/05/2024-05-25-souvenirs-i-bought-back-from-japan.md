## Introduction
In May 2024 I went on a two-week trip to Japan. I landed in Tokyo, took the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) to Kyoto, took the intercity rail to Nara, took the intercity rail to Osaka, took the Shinkansen to Yokohama, then took the intercity rail back to Tokyo. My baggage allowance flying All Nippon Airways was a carry on, a personal item that fit under the seat in front of me, and two checked bags. So, I went with two empty checked bags and stuffed one inside the other with the intention of buying lots of things to bring home. This is what I bought back home:

## Snacks
- Tokyo Banana
A day or two before our departure, I thought it was a good idea to withdraw local currency. The minimum amount was 10000 Yen which was equivalent to about 65 US dollars. I had a lot of it remaining so I spent it all at the airport duty free shops, as well as the vending machines near my gate. 
- Mochi 
From DonKi / Don Quixote

## Cups and Pitchers
### Zojirushi 1.7 Liter Water Pitcher
I saw this water pitcher pretty frequently at some dining establishments that I went to. I did some research and found out that it was an item that was made in Japan. I had to scout a couple of stores before I found it in Tokyo's Kappabashi Street (meaning Kitchen Town in Japanese). I bought two home.

## Scissors and Clippers
Green Bell, Augur, Seki Edge 

## Toyo Steel Toolboxes

## Bathing Ape

## North Face Purple Label

## Pokemon BSide Label Stickers

## Convenience Store Umbrellas
