## Introduction to San Pedro de Atacama
San Pedro de Atacama is one of the premier destinations for tourists in Chile. It is relatively easy to get to from capital via a short flight and then a bus ride or a drive. It is located in one of the driest places on Earth, the Atacama Desert, and proudly provides access to many stargazing telescopes and observatories in its proximity because of the perfect conditions to view the night sky. In addition, it is a major hotspot to get to locations where you can see beautiful rock formations, active geysers, salt flats, salt lagoons, and a volcano. 

## My Own Experience
I traveled to San Pedro de Atacama in December 2024, not from Santiago, Chile but from a Chilean beach town north called Iquique. I arrived in San Pedro by car shortly after sunrise and saw my first sight: the Cruz Papal. The Cruz Papal was the finish line for The Speed Project Atacama, and the views from the lookout point was beautiful to behold. Up next was to the inner downtown part of San Pedro de Atacama where my Airbnb was. 

After settling into the accommodation, and showering for the first time in about 50+ hours, I was hungry, and it was time for lunch. Post lunch, plans were already in place to make our way to the Speed Project afterparty.
