> Pasaraya: Supermarket Manager is a game that found its way onto one of my friends' board games shelves because it was given away to them from some other friends that bought the game and determined that it was too tough to learn. It was tough to learn mainly because the rule book was very disorganized, and you would have to piece together multiple video reviews and walkthroughs online to figure out what the real rules were.
