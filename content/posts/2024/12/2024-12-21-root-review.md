> I acquired my copy of Root one year ago around this time. It has sat in its shrink wrap until now. I never thought I would get this much enjoyment out of learning and looking up game references for a board game that was not a trading card game. I am glad to be able to unbox it and play it with the friend group that I did. 

## What is Root?

## Pre-play thoughts and preparations
In preparation to play Root for the first time, I prepared nothing. I had packed it with me with a handful of other board games on my way to an afternoon with friends, and when I suggested to play Root, the caveat being we would need to all learn it together for the first time, it came out of its shrink. It was time for Root to shine. 

## In-game thoughts and experience
The way that we got Root going on a table with all brand-new players was mainly through the use of the walkthrough scenario. We followed all the instructions for set up, and then passed the booklet around whenever it was the next player's turn. We only had three players, so naturally we skipped all sections referring to the faction that no one claimed, the Vagabond. As each player was going through the walkthrough, some players followed along, but we also had some YouTube videos playing in the background that went over the rules and sample gameplay to provide additional enrichment.

## Things that caused confusion
- We knew that the way to win primarily was to be the first to score 30 Victory Points. This would be done mainly through destroying structures and crafting items that gave victory points. One thing that we did not realize was that players don't score Victory Points for combat and the removal of warriors/ meeples. 
- One thing that was tough for us new players was not knowing the pitfalls of the other factions. The Eyrie and Marquis did not know about Martial Law where it is better for them to have at least three warriors in clearings that were potential targets for the spread of the Alliance's sympathy.

## Things I would do differently next play through
- With the knowledge of what all the factions do and the ways to play around them, and the knowledge about factions from expansions that I do not own, I now know how to better play the game.
