## What is Mycelium: A Mushling Game?
Mycelium: A Mushling Game is a route building game with heavily influenced by the luck of the draw. There are two randomized decks that players draw from that influence where victory tokens will be placed and rearranged on the map, as well as a deck that players draw to play Mushlings with different abilities. Players go in order over the span of multiple rounds until the winner, the player that gets to ten victory points first, is declared. 

## In-game thoughts and experience
Mycelium was a game that I never heard of until it was brought to the table. On the surface it looked very simple to pick up and play literally out of the box with extremely little setup. We played a very friendly game where players were very pacifist and did not attack other players' routes until more than halfway through the game. I was mainly playing for fun and realized very quickly that I was at the mercy of a chance deck. I enjoyed the game mainly because I observed how the wacky scenarios between players evolved when something outside of anybody's control happened.

## Things that caused confusion
The game was pretty simple to play and not much was left to interpretation. That being said, some interactions with how battling and the destruction of other players' routes was not very clear.  


## Things I would do differently next play through
I would take more risks and be more aggressive in with how I spent my turns. Other players may have the intel on what is going to happen in future turns, but that means that they would not have the cards in hand to defend themselves against an attack.

## Would I Play Again?
I would be down to play it an additional handful of times nonconsecutively. 6/10.
