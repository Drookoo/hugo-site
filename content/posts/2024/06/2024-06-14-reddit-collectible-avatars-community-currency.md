## Introduction
> I recently switched from the "Old Reddit" UI to the "New Reddit" UI. I'm still getting acclimated to things, but the first thing I noticed was my Reddit avatar. I knew that Reddit avatars have been out for a while now, but it was only until the last week that I decided to really see what they were all about. Reddit Avatars are collectible, tradable, and marketable on Polygon. Polygon ($MATIC) is a cryptocurrency token built on the Ethereum network. The Polygon cryptocurrency wallet attached to your account, called your Reddit Vault, are on the polygon network, so every Reddit Collectible Avatar is on the blockchain. Through different promotions and events, you can acquire (or "mint") collectible avatar non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for free. 

Prior to this week I had three Reddit Collectible Avatars (RCAs). All of them were minted at no-cost:
- Drip Squad #108952 - https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xbfd670667053e517a97afe56c91e4f83f1160bd3/108951
- Pixel Placers #46051 - https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xc8d3a3a83bde5dad06d436694e3e22ac3e64d577/3898276
- Traveler Rabbid #6013 - https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x5066c0934632bcc2902d139d7c875cbd295429f8/141312

## The Collectible Avatar Markets
The way that RCAs worked was that each one gave you a set of articles to style your Reddit Snoo just like how it is depicted in the NFT. You can mix and mash items from one RCA with items from another to create something really cool or something hideous. Now you can also purchase RCAs from Reddit directly using real US dollars. Many RCAs are limited to a couple tens, hundreds, or thousands and this has sparked a huge secondary market. 

## Cults
With the way things were going, certain communities on Reddit began to spring up. Communities were formed to gather users that owned the same limited NFTs together, and you know how those usually go on the internet. These are the communities that I stumbled upon in the order that I found them in: 
- /r/Coneheads - https://reddit.com/r/Coneheads
- /r/Bucketheads - https://reddit.com/r/bucketheads
- /r/Aetherheads - https://reddit.com/r/Aetherheads
- and more like /r/Bellheads, /r/Poopheadavatars/, /r/PlungerPlanet, /r/MushroomPlanet/, etc.
