> Loopring is an Ethereum token that touts itself as the world’s first zkRollup provider (a protocol for low-cost payments and transfers - think Zelle) for Ethereum’s Layer 2 (This means that it lives on the Ethereum blockchain). Ethereum is by far the largest and most reliable cryptocurrency network out there, but transactions on the network became expensive with high fees due to its large market share. Loopring was made to allow for low-cost transactions on the Ethereum network.

# In the Beginning
I first found out about Loopring through its co-mingling with GameStop shortly after its infamous squeeze in June 2022. GameStop was revealed to build a partnership with Loopring and another Ethereum L2 currency, Immutable X. Loopring’s strengths were in payment processing, Immutable X’s strengths were in Web3 gaming. 

I installed the Loopring wallet, bought some “Loops” off of Coinbase and transferred them into my new snazzy Loopring wallet. In the weeks that came, I learned more about the Loopring community, got familiar with its roadmap, and learned more about what it had to offer in terms of innovation to the cryptocurrency space. I collected NFTs, contributed to the Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools that provided liquidity, and checked the app every day to collect sign in bonuses. 

Since 2022, I haven’t really kept up with all that was happening with the community. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs were entering a bear market that coincided with rising interest rates to tackle inflation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Present Day
Fast-forward two years later to this week in June **2024**. 
I get a notification of discord from the #announcements channel on the Loopring discord about a compromise to user wallets from a threat actor that leveraged Loopring’s 2fa to illegitimately authorize themselves as the owner of the wallets and thus then were able to change ownership and withdraw assets from wallets. 

I quickly checked my wallet to see if my wallet was compromised and gave out a sigh of relief when my assets were all there. I retrieved my collateral from the AMM liquidity pools, and quickly looked into how to move my tokens across the layers of Ethereum fabric. I was able to easily transfer my Loops to my Centralized Exchange (CEX) and sell them without an issue. 

There is a lot of speculation making its rounds across the cryptocurrency internet communities about the compromise. This event and opportunity gave me the incentive to drop Loopring from my cryptocurrency portfolio.
