> I raced the half-marathon distance for the first time at the 2024 Brooklyn Queens Brewery Express thanks to a complimentary bib that was given away by Asian Trail Mix. The race was on Saturday, June 8th at 5pm and started in Glendale, NY. 


## Pre race üò∞
I was still traveling (in Japan) when I got the notice that I was a lucky recipient of a race bib from a giveaway by Asian Trail Mix for the 2024 Brooklyn Queens Brewery Express Half Marathon. I promptly signed up for the race with the provided registration code. I knew I was a little out of running shape because I did not run too much prior to my Japan trip, so I knew that I had to be diligent about training. I tried to squeeze in as much running as I could possible over the next two weeks, but I was really only able to get a good consistent running schedule a week before the race. I had a strong base, so I knew that I was fine, but I knew that it was going to take a miracle before I was in race performance. I ran five out of the six days leading up to the race, and that‚Äôs what I brought with me to the start line. 

## Race Day üöÄ
I wore head to toe in mostly New Balance gear:
```sh
Sprints Inc Running hat
Asian Trail Mix ‚ÄúYear of the Dragon‚Äù New Balance singlet
Spongebob boxers
New Balance race shorts
Darn Tough Socks
New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4 
```

Columbus Circle to Glendale was two subways and a bus ride away, but I made sure that I was adequately fueled and hydrated to go the distance. One thing that I don‚Äôt enjoy feeling before going on a run is any sort of hungry feeling. On the flip side I also dislike the feeling of being too full while running either. I had a heavy breakfast and a lot of Japanese mochi for an afternoon snack and three bananas while I was on the Q55 on the way from the L Train stop to the start line. 

I had a pretty good understanding that the race was just four left turns with a handful of aid stations with no road closures. It was very unlikely to break any sort of personal record with the probable amount of stopping that I was going to encounter. Plus, I had no experience with the types of road conditions that I was going to face while I ran the course. 

I started out quite quickly and fast, but realized very quickly that I was in no shape to really push myself. Temperatures were hovering around 80 degrees at that point, but I knew that I was going to slow myself down prior to reaching the first aid station. 

On the way to the second aid station (by Bushwick Ave and Jamaica Ave), crewed by Asian Trail Mix, the sidewalk was a lot more uneven. There were a lot of cars, mostly in traffic, and a pretty large elevation gain. I was drinking a small bottle of Poland Spring quite quickly after I received it, mainly because I did not want to run with the water shaking around in the bottle. The way to the third aid station (by Jamaica Ave and Myrtle Ave) was a little more busy in terms of street traffic, but it got pretty relaxed after passing it. I crossed past the start line (the racecourse is a big loop and then some), and prepared to make the final left turn to the finish. When I got to the finish, I realized that I was short on miles. My watch calculated only 12.6 miles, so I crossed the finish line, tore the finishing tag off my race bib and proceeded to run more to get to 13.1.

## Post race üòå

The finish line and post race festivities was at Evil Twin Brewing. Finishers got their medal and pint glass and there was water, Gatorade, and pizza going around. I didn‚Äôt finish as fast as I hoped to, but I‚Äôm glad to look onwards and be more prepared for the next one.
