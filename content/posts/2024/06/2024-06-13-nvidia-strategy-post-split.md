## Background
This Monday on June 10, 2024, Nvidia completed its 1:10 split, and for every share that you owned at the close of post-market trading hours on the previous Friday meant that you will be distributed 9 more shares with a share price adjustment divided by 10. I’ve been holding onto Nvidia for quite some time now. I’ve been buying it since 2016 when I started trading on Robinhood. Then I bought more when I transferred all of my assets out of Robinhood, and switched to Fidelity, because Robinhood decided to disable the buy button for a very particular super stock. This is my intended strategy for the stock and the company after its recent 1:10 stock split.

## How It Was Going
I was selling covered calls on my 100 shares of Nvidia, and was assigned while I was on a 12-hour non-stop flight from Tokyo to New York City (my fault, I should've known better). With my new-found realized gains, I sold a cash secured put and used the proceeds of the stock sale as collateral. This cash secured put had a post split expiration date so, on Monday morning I had 10 contracts sold with the new adjusted strike price. 

## The Big Question now is
It is currently the Friday after the post split Monday, and my sold contracts are going to expire worthless. (Though I do intend to buy the contracts back for 0.01 each. I used to buy them back for $1, but now they will be worth $10 - 0.01 x 100 x 10). I don’t intend to continue to sell cash secured puts on Nvidia or for the hundreds of shares that I am currently holding. So I have quite a bit of cash from leftover collateral to spend. **What am I going to do with it?**

## Blueprinting
1. I’m going to first and foremost buy shares on the best performing stock in my portfolio - Nvidia. I intend to dollar cost average to stretch my buying power in order to...
2. Continue selling cash secured puts! Sure I can sell more of them than ever before, but cash secured puts tie up a lot of your liqui equity. So I am only going to sell a couple at a time with longer theta.
3. Buy ETFs that track the broad market SP500 index. For this target, I'm heavily leaning towards `$SPLG` for my ETF of choice. Its expense ratio makes it cheaper to own than `$VOO` (0.02 vs 0.03 as of the time of writing). But I might just stick with buying `$VOO`, because I already have a sizeable position in it. There is not much sense in holding two ETFs that track the SP500.
4. Start selling cash secured puts for SPY. I know, I know, owning SPY is a bummer compared to other tickers. But if I get assigned, I would be owning it for hopefully a discount. I like it because it is very liquid, and has contracts that expire three times a week. My strategy is to sell cash secured puts on `$SPY` a month out and collect value from time decay (theta). Options are priced based on a variety of factors, but one thing that is certain is that theta always decays to 0 near the contract's expiration date. 
5. Increase my cash allocation that I have set aside into my four-week treasury bill ladder. I previously downsized it to load up on Nvidia shares pre-split, but I’m quite content with the week-to-week returns. I am also fairly confident that interest rates will hold out for at least the next month.
6. Increase my holdings in my blue chip stocks - mainly `$MSFT`.
