My first stop in Chile was Puerto Natales. I almost did not make it there because I missed my internation to domestic connection in Santiago, Chile. 

The LATAM ticket sales people at the counter told me that there were no more flights to Puerto Natales for the day, and I could go to the next town over instead and bus to where I was supposed to go.
So, to keep the itinerary the same, I got on the next flight to Punta Arenas and got on a two hour uber ride to Puerto Natales. The airport was closed.
