This post is a part of series of posts called "A Part of Me", or APoM for short.
It is meant to document my upbringing with various subjects that matter the most to me. 
These topics and hobbies define who I am to date, and subsequently have proven to stand the test of time. 
My experiences are eternalized here on my blog site until I do something else with them.
Perhaps video based supplements in the future. 

This is my second post of the series that focuses on games.

## Abstract
Inspired by reading [Branching Paths: A Life in Games](https://muditaheart.itch.io/branching-paths-a-life-in-games) by `@muditaheart`, and looking back at some of my YouTube videos where it's been almost a decade since I started [playing League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8WJ4AI7Dwo), I've decided that there should be a post dedicated to games. 

## Windows 95 // Windows XP
- I remember I had either a Windows 95 or Windows XP Laptop. It had Solitaire and Chess, `3D Pinball for Windows â€“ Space Cadet`, and `Hover!` 

## Gameboy SP - NES edition
Growing up I remember asking for a Nintendo for Christmas. I didn't know the Nintendo ecosystem very well but I gave my relative a list of potential things that that I wanted for Christmas and I ended up with the Gameboy SP NES Edition along with four classic NES games ported to the Gameboy: Ice Climbers, Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, and Donkey Kong. I was able to get my hands on my Cousin's copy of Final Fantasy IV and later on Pokemon FireRed. Out of the initial four that I got my hands on, I knew that TLoZ was the hardest out the bunch. Unlike Mario or Ice Climbers or Donkey Kong, strategy was derived less from being good but more about knowing insitutional knowledge about the game. For the longest time I couldn't get over the first jump in Mario Bros because I didn;t understand that you can jump further if you do it while running. 


## Nintendo DSi 
The Nintendo DSi was more or less a hand me down from another relative. It had pirated games on it. I played a lot of Pokemon Diamond. I remember wrapping my head around using the Action Replay to access the area that contained Arceus. 
Pokemon Diamond, Nintendogs, Cooking mama
Wario ware
Final Fantasy 3

## PSVita 
Marvel vs Capcom, Viewtiful Joe, Phoenix wright 
I had access to my relative's PSvita and through that I was exposed to games like Marvel vs Capcom, Viewtiful Joe, and Phoenix Wright. 

## Windows Vista
- I think the only game that I remember playing was Chess Titans, Purple Place, Inkball, Solitaire, FreeCell, and Inkball. 
- I then got hold of Starcraft 2, and `Civilization IV: The Complete Edition` which included Warlords, Beyond the Sword, and Colonization. 

## Flash games:
- Runescape, Pokemon Crater, the run of the mill stuff that you would go to the library to get your 40 minutes of computer time each day. to go on flash game aggregator sites. 

- Fast forward to the windows Vista. I believe that Chess came default on that one. 

In either fifth or sixth grade, our humanities teacher brought in a guest speaker. Her name was Yang Shan, and she gave a talk about her experience making games. She demoed a few games to us and I felt very inspired to play more games!

## Games games
A lot of MMORPGs. If it was free to play, I probably played it with my friends. If it was a subscription based model, then we played a private server varient with boosted rate and free. 
Maplestory.
Private Servers. 
Dragonica // Dragon Saga

## League of Legends
This honestly ate up more of my life then it was supposed to. I remember getting in front of of my my freshmen elective classes in high school and essentially professing my love for the game and pitching its glory to other 18 year olds learning earth sciencec geometry. 

## Steam 
My first dive into Steam that I can remember was: `Sep 18, 2011	Learning with Portals`. I signed up for the platform initially but didn't spend too much time on it because most of the good stuff required real world money and I wasn't interested in Team Fortress. Muditaheart and PRPHD told this to me in passing and so I logged onto the first time in a while to claim the freebie. 

But I must have used steam to play other games, ofc F2P, because my steam account was created late June

Humble Bundle, Origin Game Launcher
