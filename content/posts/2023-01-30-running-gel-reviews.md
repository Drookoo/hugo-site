My girlfriend bought me a variety of Running Gels from the Fleet Feet store near our apartment for the holidays so I can use them when I run timed races, and bike long routes. So this post is solely for me to track and review the gels that I've consumed.   

# GU Roctane Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review |
| -----  | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Vanilla Orange | 2022-12-30 | Yes | Run | This was my first gel ever. I took this shortly after mile 6 in a 13 mile run. This tasted very vile. The caffeine added was nice to have, but swallowing the gel was an excruciating experience. At that time I wish I had more after my body spent it. I probably should have intaked water after consumption.|
| Lemonade | 2023-01-31 | No | Run | At first taste this definately did not taste like lemonade. This flavor had a more lemon cake type of taste. A little jarring upon first taste but my body was getting more accustomed to the flavor profiles that GU's running gels had. With this gel I was able to PR a 10K in Central Park a little before midnight. | 

# GU Original Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review | 
| ------ | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Strawberry Banana | 2023-01-29 | No | Run | My second gel. This time I decided to pick a flavor without any caffeine. I took this shortly after mile 7 in a 15 mile run, butI didn't intake any water until mile 10/11. The taste was fine, it tasted exactly like strawberries and bananas albiet a little thick when held in my mouth. I squeezed out every last drop and wished there was more. I didn't feel any benefit, short or prolonged, without the caffeine. |  
| Salted Caramel | 2023-02-04 | Yes | Run | This tasted exactly like it was supposed to. I consumed it on an empty stomach before a 5k (Bridgeathon 2023!) and felt like it was beneficial to have in my system. But because I didn't have the full serving, the influence of the gel probably was not a whole lot. |
