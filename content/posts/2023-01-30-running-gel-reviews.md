My girlfriend bought me a variety of Running Gels from the Fleet Feet store near our apartment for the holidays, so I can use them when I run timed races, and bike long routes. So this post is solely for me to track and review the gels that I've consumed.   

# GU Roctane Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review |
| -----  | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Vanilla Orange | 2022-12-30 | Yes, 35 mg | Run | This was my first gel ever. I took this shortly after mile 6 in a thirteen-mile run. This tasted very vile. The caffeine added was nice to have, but swallowing the gel was an excruciating experience. At that time I wish I had more after my body spent it. I probably should have intaked water after consumption.|
| Lemonade | 2023-01-31 | No | Run | At first taste this definitely did not taste like lemonade. This flavor had a more lemon cake type of taste. A little jarring upon first taste, but my body was getting more accustomed to the flavor profiles that GU's running gels had. With this gel I was able to PR a 10K in Central Park a little before midnight. | 
| Pineapple | 2023-04-01 | No | Run | This flavor was fine. Although I didn't get an opportunity to use it completely because I pulled something in my knee, so I had to drop out of the group run (OMRC) early. High on the list for likability. | 


# GU Original Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review | 
| ------ | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Strawberry Banana | 2023-01-29 | No | Run | My second gel. This time I decided to pick a flavor without any caffeine. I took this shortly after mile 7 in a 15-mile run, but I didn't intake any water until mile 10/11. The taste was fine, it tasted exactly like strawberries and bananas albeit a little thick when held in my mouth. I squeezed out every last drop and wished there was more. I didn't feel any benefit, short or prolonged, without the caffeine. |  
| Salted Caramel | 2023-02-04 | Yes, 20 mg | Run | This tasted exactly like it was supposed to. I consumed it on an empty stomach before a 5k (Bridgeathon 2023!) and felt like it was beneficial to have in my system. But because I didn't have the full serving, the influence of the gel probably was not a lot. |
| Lemon Sublime | 2023-02-06 | No | Run | I'm getting more and more used to the taste of the GU energy gels. This one tastes very similar to the GU Roctane one, but tastes more of a fruit than a pastry. |  
| Tastefully Nude | 2023-02-20 | Yes, 20 mg | Run | This should have been my first running gel. But it still had a slight taste to it. It definitely wasn't flavorless. But the caffeine content seemed kind of light in this serving. Probably a no for me in the future. |
| Campfire S'mores | 2023-03-18 | No | Run | This ain't it chief. If only I appreciated smores more. |
| Cola me happy |  2023-03-20 | No | Run | This one is fine. Didn't taste like soda or anything, but I guess it is a good thing that it doesn't like corn syrup. |
| Mint Chocolate | 2023-03-22 | Yes, 20 mg | Run | This one was quite pleasant. It tastes just like how you would envision it. This is high on the list |
