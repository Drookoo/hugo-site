In my quest to produce better video content - scripted content that has better structure - I've decided to invest in some quality of life improvements to my home filming location setup. 

I recently acquired some excellent lavalier microphones with wireless transmitters and a receiver, and am super impressed with the sound quality that I got out of them.

So the next upgrade I was eyeing was better lighting. 

From my local audio video supplier, I found a three-pack kit of GVM 800D-RGB LED Light Panels with excellent reviews. 

When the package came, I was shocked at how heavy the entire kit was. I should have done a weight comparison, because there is a lot of weight in that box. 

The clamshell zip organizer could be better. 

Setup was a breeze, just simple plug and play and a fiddling of knobs, and off I went. 

What was assuring was that the package indicated that GVM had a strong tie with my preferred retailer of some sort.
