One thing that I recently realized was that I was accumulating enough $SOFI stock that I could start selling covered calls. This topic is very intriguing to me because of the relatively low risk strategies involved that can still net you residual income that you collect through options premiums. With my 500 shares of $SOFI, I decided to sell five contracts for $11 strike expiring on 08/04/2023. I gained $0.41 of premium per share and netted $201.60 after commission and fees. 

As long as the price of $SOFI is under $11 at 4PM on the expiration date, I get to keep my shares and collect the entire premium. Out of the fifteen or so days that the contract was valid, the price of $SOFI only passed the strike price for one day. That day just happened to be the morning after earnings report where better than expected results and sentiment was given which mooned the stock past my strike. It wasn't able to hold, and the calls were out of the money by the next morning. 

To close out the contracts early, I attempted to buy them back at 0.01 just so I could exit sooner and sell more calls. But I ultimately let them expire worthless to save a couple of dollars. 

All in all this was a fun experience. Usually you start selling covered calls after you get assigned shares from selling a put that on a stock that you don't mind holding. For me, I was holding $SOFI for a long time and was able to get a superb average cost basis for loading up near the bottom.
