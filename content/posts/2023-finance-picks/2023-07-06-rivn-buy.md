I'm not normally a big automotive person. Most people know that I'm big on public transit and micromobility. So a pick on an automotive manufacturer is a hit out of the ballpark for someone like me. But recently, I have been seeing more and more news about how well Rivian is performing in terms of its delivery and future prospects. Over the July fourth weekend in East Hampton, I had the pleasure of getting my miles in the Altra Torin 7's, a zero drop running shoe, so naturally I got to see a lot of Hamptons beach traffic. I was surprised to see a ton of Rivian R1S just stuck in traffic. I have seen Rivians here and there on New York City streets, mostly the Amazon electric delivery vans, but have noticed the consumer models that stand out from the rest of the cars on the road. I had a feeling that Rivian was going to be the automotive play especially if the things get more and more rosy. 

Amazon recently got the green light to expand their Rivian electric delivery van fleet in Germany. If they can make it in Germany, they can make it anywhere in the European Union. All of these coals to the flame cemented my sentiment in buying Rivian, so I scooped up 25 shares at $20.70
