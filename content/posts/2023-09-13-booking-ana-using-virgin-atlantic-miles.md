## Introduction
I was approaching my one-year anniversary with the Chase Sapphire Reserve. I accumulated a ton of points - 100,000 of them during with a sign-up bonus. So I knew that with no trips abroad on my calendar, I needed to plan a big trip to celebrate. I decided that I wanted to go to Japan, for it would be my first time in Asia as an adult. I have always wanted to go one day, and I hope my experience booking an Air Nippon Airways flight using Virgin Atlantic miles might help someone out.

## Steps
So from doing my research, you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Virgin Atlantic miles 1:1. Virgin Atlantic is partnered with All Nippon Airways, and All Nippon Airways (ANA) is a Star Alliance Member. So my steps to pull this through are as follows:
1. Make a Virgin Atlantic Account
2. Through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, transfer your points to Virgin Atlantic Miles. 
3. Sign onto your account through United Airlines, and look for flights operated by ANA that can be purchased with award miles.
4. Call Virgin Atlantic, and tell the representative, which dates you are flying and the flight number. They will be able to book your flight. 
5. Pay whatever taxes and fees there are to confirm your booking.

Sounds simple right? 

Not really. As a first timer of transferring credit card points to airline partners to buy flights from another airline using the search functionality of another airline, this was a daunting task. 

## Steps 1 and 2: Virgin Atlantic Account Creation and Points Transfer
These are by far the easiest steps. I have never flown with Virgin Atlantic before, but I have used their lounge in JFK Airport through my Priority Pass. Signing up for a new account was a breeze, and transferring Chase Ultimate Rewards points out of the Chase Portal into Virgin Atlantic miles was easy and instant. 

## Step 3: Finding ANA Flights Based on Award Availability on United. 
So here is the tricky part. You need to find ANA operated flights that can be purchased using miles that can be bought using Virgin Atlantic miles. The way to do this is you're based in the United States is to go on the United Airlines website and search for flights that can be booked using United Airlines Miles. ANA is a part of Star Alliance, so all airlines within that group will appear on all the other airlines' websites.

The thing that throws everything in the wrench is that the flight needs to be operated by Air Nippon Airways and have a flight code prefixed with "NH". Flights that are prefixed by "UA" but operated by ANA cannot be bought by Virgin Atlantic Miles. This might take a couple of minutes, it might take a couple of hours. Thankfully the United Airlines website is not horrible, so even though I found no roundtrip flights to Tokyo from NYC, I was able to piece together my round trip itinerary using two nonstop one-way flights. 

## Step 4: Interact with Virgin Atlantic
This step required you to pick up the phone and call Virgin Atlantic. You essentially tell them your intention, which is to book an ANA flight using Virgin Atlantic miles, and to tell them what days do you depart and return. They work their magic and when they hit, they ask you how you found the applicable flight without having the tools of an airline employee, then you cross your fingers and hope the spell completely casts. For myself, this took about 45 minutes due to "API Errors", I elude this to spaghetti code, but the representative was able to jam it in when I confirmed on the consumer side that the flight still showed up on the United website. 

## Step 5: Payment and Confirmation:
You'll confirm that you want to spend your points plus any extra dollars for taxes and fees, and you'll get an email confirmation within minutes. Cheers!
