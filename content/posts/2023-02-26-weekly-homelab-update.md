This week was an eventful week. Some notable things that happened: 
- Moved all my selfhosted containers off the Synology onto one of the Optiplexes. This was long overdue. 
- Set up my 12U server rack. From top to bottom: Switch, Optiplexes, NAS. End result: cooler temps (~10 degrees C) + one 50ft CAT7 cable (needs to be longer tbh) suspended using 3M string light mounts. Super Rad!
- Set up my 2nd Optiplex for the SANS GREM course. BH Photo was handing out Crucial MX500 1TB SSDs (I wish they were m2) like government handouts, so of course I had to get one if I was setting up a new box.
