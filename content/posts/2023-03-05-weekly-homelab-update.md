# Some notable things from this month:
- Deployed new services: a zine reader, and a flickr alternative! 
- Realized that the ethernet port on my personal portable machine had a fast ethernet network card. Data transfer speeds were slower over the wire as opposed to wireless. No fear, there is already a dedicated windows box that was set up last week that can carry the burden. The personal portable machine can remain as a jumpbox. 
- Realized that WSL is not it for for sshing onto my boxes. PuTTy is the vibe.
