This week is a fun one. Last week's post was on hiatus because of personal travel to London and Paris. Some notable things that happened this week:

- Paid for my first VPN service: Mullvad. No brainer behind the decision here. 
- Set up Jellyfin on one of my Optiplex Micros. 
- Reorganized my shared folders on my Synology NAS to accomodate the Jellyfin platform. 
- Set up another Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS Certificate to point to my Jellyfin service.
- Bought equipment from BH to improve my lab. Realized that I should have paid more attention to my cart when I checked out. 
- Started to test CrowdSec on one of my boxes with an agent and bouncer.
