## Welcome! 

This is my blog, and it's being self-hosted on my datacenter in my one studio Manhattan apartment.

As of January 2023:
- The domain name has been bought with a ten year lease. 
- The version control history of the site is backed on [Github](https://github.com/Drookoo/hugo-site)
- It uses a Golang based static site generator named [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and uses the PaperMod theme.
- Updates to site content from upstream are automated using cron. 
- This is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with 1 GB of Memory. The barcode on the box that the Pi came in says I acquired it from MicroCenter for $29.99 
- The SSL/TLS certificate provisioning and renewals are all handled by the Synology DSM.
- The Synology also handles the reverse proxy to route incoming connections to the Raspberry Pi.
