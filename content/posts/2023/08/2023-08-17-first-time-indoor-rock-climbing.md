A team lead at one of Arc'teryx's newest New York City stores passed along information about an amazing inclusive group that meets at indoor rock climbing gyms in the New York City area called the "BIPOC Climbing Collective" on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bipocclimbingcollective/). In lieu of learning how to play Mahjong at the Ace Hotel with Chop Suey Club that evening, my girlfriend and I took the Uptown express to Harlem 125th Street where we walked two blocks to get to The Cliffs at Harlem. The location was very convenient for us via public transit and the gym was located right across the street from the Apollo Theater. 

For the event, the gym offered a discount of fifteen dollars for the entrance pass and seven more dollars for rental shoes and chalk. We signed the venue's safety waiver, picked up our rentals, and made our way into the gym. A few hours prior, I did my homework and looked at the event space on Google Maps to get an understanding of what I was going into beforehand. I knew what rock climbing was, but have never physically stepped into a physical space where people rock climb.

When I walked into the gym, I was blown away by the intricate walls with patterns, different workout and training tools, and of course the skill of the climbers climbing. We introduced ourselves to Trevor, the organizer, and he gave us a quick introduction to the space while we sat tight for announcements to come. Everyone went around in a circle and introduced themselves and shared how long they have been climbing and how they found the group. Many people who came that night had mutual friends that introduced them to climbing and thus became friends mutually as well which was cool to see the connections forming. 

Trevor was able to get us that were new to climbing up and running with the lingo, the way to fall, and how to climb a course. We then were left to our own devices and given the opportunity to explore and climb.
Mia and I did various V0 and V1 level courses that the gym offered, some that were more successful than others, and met some really cool people that were just starting out with climbing. 

The night concluded with climbing day pass raffles, drink raffles, and a shoe raffle. 

Thanks to the Arc'teryx team for letting me know about the event, and we will definitely make it out to the next one.
