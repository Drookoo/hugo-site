## Introduction
Every year my employer sponsors one GIAC certification training and exam. For those not in the know, these are information security courses that prepare you for the respective exam that range from cyber defense, cloud security, digital forensics, to penetration testing, red teaming, and industrial control systems security. For the past five months I was supposed to be studying the course `FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware: Malware Analysis Tools and Techniques`, but I held off everything until the end. Last year, I studied the entirety of `SEC540: Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation` in about a week and passed the exam. This year, I studied about 90% of the course content 24 hours before the exam. I also passed the associated exam, with a higher score than last year's test even though that one was more related to what I did day to day. 

## Contents of the course
The course went through all the fundamentals of malware analysis and reverse engineering. Then it dropped you in the deep end using various monitoring tools, debugging tools, decompiling tools, disassembly tools on malicious executables to bring you up to speed. I was able to get more famililarity with the space and left with a trove of knowledge that include:
- Performing behavioral analysis with tools like wireshark, process monitor, process hacker, Fakedns, and etc.
- Performing static properties analysis using tools like PeStudio, Detect it Easy
- Code Analysis using Ghidra, x64dbg/ x32dbg, Scylla, OllyDumpEx, and etc.
- I was able to takeaway a lot of Windows API calls, and how assembly instructions worked.
- Analzying malicious PDF documents, VBA macros embedded in microsoft office documents.
- Deobfuscating and unpacking malicious executables and scripts.
- Probably most importantly, using Ghidra to read disassembled and decompiled code while utilizing the built in debugger to examine how the malicious executable behaves at certain critical function calls.

## Outcomes and Thoughts
The vigorous course was made exponentially much more difficult because I was cramming everything in the final hour. I was not able to get the opportunity to take any practice tests, but I was able to score fairly well in the quizes at the end of each section. Like all GIAC exams, you could take your study notes on paper with you into the test location. I was flipping pages back and forth and using the glossary heavily to reinforce the knowledge in my printed notes and in my head. I'm thankful that the hands on lab exam questions didn't derive too far from the ones in the course. I know for sure next time, I would not have to spend twenty minutes trying to read the last four characters of a md5 hash. I'm glad that I recieved a passing grade and wass able to takeway the knowledge of the tools and techniques for reverse engineering and analyzing malware. One thing that I'm bummed about is that the framed certificate that you can pay more for at the passing of your test seems to be different this year. It unfortunately will not match the framed one that I ordered from last year.
