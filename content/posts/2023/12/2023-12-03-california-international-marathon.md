> I ran the 2023 California International Marathon in Sacramento on Sunday, December 03 2023. It was my first ever marathon and my first time in Sacramento. I stayed in West Sacramento for two nights leading up to the race.  

## Pre Race Jitters ðŸ˜°
My Saturday morning shakeout the day before the big race was with On Running at Temple Coffee Roasters. Bandit had a shakeout too, but it was way out in East Sacramento and Google Maps showed you a picture of an excavated hole in the ground in someoneâ€™s backyard when you looked up the address. The shakeout had demo shoes, coffee, water, and pastries and was conveniently located pretty close to the bib pickup site. After walking around the marathon expo with all the freebies in hand, my friend group and I made our way to Saigon Alley.
   
A lunch with Vietnamese pho, summer rolls, and fried quail was going to be my second to last pre race meal. The restaurant was very upscale in terms of all the other places that I frequent in NYC for pho. When the waitstaff brings out your bowl of pho, it comes sans broth. The staff then pours the soup from a traditional kettle right in front of you. 

Post lunch my friends and I split up. I spent the afternoon walking around Downtown and Old Sac, trying to determine what to eat for dinner. This was a big rookie mistake, because during this walk, it became increasingly clear that my dinner was going to be either Vodka Penne from Yard House or Barbecue chicken soup sauce on pizza. 

My pre-race dinner that night ended up to be from some hole in the wall taco joint + Hispanic grocery combo in some strip mall in West Sac called Niko's Tacos. Those Tacos were fairly salty, and I sipped a Maurten 320 before I went to sleep at 7pm.

## Race Day Shenanigans ðŸš€
On the morning of the race day, I had some green apples that Mia swiped from a bowl at the front desk of our hotel. They were very waxy, but I knew I needed the fibrous content that I would later find out to result in one of the top two all time most fulfilling poops in my life at the marathon start line portable toilet. 

I started with the 3:40 group. My longest run ever was 16 miles looping in CP, and the pace group was non-negotiable, because I took my time getting into the corrals. It also just seemed like the right pace for me.

As I was running the course, I got increasingly upset over the fact that many homeowners had their garbage and recycling bins out on the street - no sidewalk in American suburbia on a Sunday. In addition to the obstacles, fallen leaves littered the course. I pushed my pace to the 3:35 group, then to the 3:30 group, and then to the 3:20 group without any issue. I soon discovered very early that I disliked pace groups. But I'm a thin individual and I thread the needle all the time during NYRR races back home, so why not do it here now? 

Along the way I saw Central Park Track Club and Old Man Run Club runners running (he introduced me that his name was Drew. I thought to myself No freaking way, that's my name! But Iâ€™ve never seen this person before) And of course I saw the ATM family too. People cheering my name on the course fueled me to the fullest extent. My name that day happened to be "Harlem", because that was what my race tee said. So, it was much more disproportionately entertaining for me than it was for the spectators when I ran past.

I spotted a Brooklyn Track Club cheer sign, a Chinatown Runners cheer sign, and a dude that I recognized but did not know the name of standing in some random place on the ascent of a hill that I later learned to be @piercedphotos. This thoroughly bothered me for a long time thinking about who this person was, because my facial recognition synapses werenâ€™t firing.

At the halfway point of the race, Mile 13.1, I legitimately thought I could run a 7:30 min/pace for another 13.1 miles. But you can see that I was doing something very different compared to the other 97% of runners on the course that day: Everyone wore shorts, but I decided to wear long Bandit Running pants :) 
In addition, prior to the race horn firing at the start line, I threw all of my Saltstick chews and extra GUs away, because I feared that I would be burdened by carrying them. I ended up getting heat cramps, and started experiencing these incredible feeling sensations in the areas in my legs that I've never felt before. Thus commence the high knee run walk waddle to the finish line starting at mile 18.

## Post Race ðŸ˜Œ
```sh
Half Marathon Time: 1:35:27
Full Marathon Time: 3:48:44
```
I finished the race in 3:48:44. This is equivalent to an 8:44 minute per mile pace. I thought I was doing quite well until I realized that I was thoroughly not prepared to run 26.2 miles.  
I had a very fun time for my first 48 hours ever in Sacramento.
