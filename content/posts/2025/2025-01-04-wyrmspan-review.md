## What is Wyrmspan?
Wyrmspan is the more complex brother to the popular bird engine building game - Wingspan. In Wyrmspan each player is an explorer that can excavate a new cave, entice a dragon into an excavated cave, or explore a cave with a dragon in side of it. Performing any of the three actions 

## Preparing to play:
It has been a while since I played Wingspan, and the last time I played it was the only time I played it. In preparation to play Wingspan, I read the rule book cover to cover and watched a handful of videos on YouTube to fully grasp the game mechanics. I did not check any card spoilers or anything that was outside the bounds of the rule book and videos.

## In-game thoughts, strategy, and experience
While playing Wyrmspan, the play group that I played with were Wingspan veterans that owned the based game and all currently released expansions. I was the only person at the table that was out of touch with these Stonemaier-span games. As a new player, I was overcome with analysis paralysis. I could not tell which of my opening cave and dragon cards were good or bad. I made my best judgement and continued play. Throughout gameplay, I figured out that some dragon abilities were much stronger than others. The dragons that I felt like were a lower tier than the rest were the ones where its ability only activated when the dragon was enticed, or once a turn during the end. 

Going into the game I did not have an elaborate strategy other than to have fun. I started the game by discarding 2 cave cards and keeping all four of my dragons, and I ended the game with 93 points that put me in second place behind the player that scored 117, and in front of third place that scored 81. While I was playing I heavily utilized the explore action over and over again to gain resources in order to cache them for more resources (and more end game points). Another player was building an engine to pay lower costs to play more expensive dragons, and the other player was focused on dragons that scored them the most points.


## Things that caused confusion
One thing that our playgroup had difficulty with was wondering if the resource/ food tokens were unlimited. Initially, we thought the 9s of rule did not apply until end of round (as opposed to end of turn), so I was piling on 14-15 meat and milk tokens while the supply was running dry. We were also starting to cache more and more resources onto our enticed dragons, so this led to a scarcity in available tokens.  

## Things I would do differently next play through
I for sure would like to utilize caves more extensively. I was pretty lean with using my third row on the player board, but the others at the table were very heavily utilizing it.

## Would I Play Wyrmspan Again?
Sure, there is a lot of replayability in Wyrmspan and now that I know what some cards of the deck do, I probably make more and more educated decisions the more that I played. 9/10
