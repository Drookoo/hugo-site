It was a slow week this week. Mostly just accumulating, documenting, and accessing inventory. 

Notable things:
- Figuring out to implement more features from the PaperMod's demostration site onto this very site. No luck with favicons, but that isn't a hard stop. 
- Setting up proper inventory of all the assets and miscellaneous accessories (drives, memory modules, etc)
- Started to set up one of my optiplex boxes, named wafflesbox, with upgraded memory modules and Ubuntu server loaded. 

# Questions on my mind:
- How to implement ethernet level speeds and reliability without using a really long ethernet cable?
- Doing more homework about a true privacy focused VPN purchase. The only blocker currently is cost and how important it is to start a monthly subscription now (travel, professional life, and personal life come in play here).
