I just watched the Barbie (2023) movie at my local AMC theater about a week after opening weekend. The theater was packed with movie goers on a Thursday 9:30pm evening. It seemed like every auditorium was filled, there were about thirty people on the concession line. There were about less than five staff members which was a little bit of an issue because other movie goers were sitting in my seats when I walked into the auditorium. 

The first few scenes of the movie really seems like one giant advertisement. There was very little context on why things were the way they were, until the plot started to roll. 

One thing that I couldn't wrap my head around was why was there an Asian Ken, but no Asian Barbie. There was evidence that there was in the beginning where they showed off how many ethnicities and professions they made the Barbie into. 

I appreciated how the finance nerd in me got a little excited when the topic of Treasury bills, bonds, and Certificate of Deposits came up briefly in the movie. 

The Chillies fan in me also go very excited when you see Will Ferrell at the helm of the board room holding a pair of two drumsticks, presumably because of his resemblance to his real life doppelganger Chad Smith (who plays the drums for the Chillies).
