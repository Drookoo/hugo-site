This week ending 2023-01-29, plus a few days, was the first week I began to utilize my computing equipment to run a homelab. 

Notable things: 
- Bought this domain name: drewku.com! 
- Printed an insert for my Raspberry Pi, mainly to protect it and keep the dust away while it's in the closet. 
- Installed Ubuntu server core on the Raspberry Pi using the GUI desktop application. Long gone are the days of using Rufus, or whaterver, to flash microSDs. 
- Went to Costco for groceries, and checked out the Cyberpower System Battery Backup with surge protection that was available to purchase. The pricetag ($129.99) was quite high for me. Plus I'm currently not trying to fit more things in the closet. So an uninterruptable power supply purchase will sit on the backburner for now.
- Installed Docker on my Synology NAS to start deploying containers to selfhost. With the utilization of SSL/TLS certs, Synology Webstation, and the built in reverse proxy, I was able to get my [linktree clone](https://links.drewku.com) up and running. 
- Used github actions 
- Evaluated the google cloud free tier and decided that paying extra money for computational power and networking when I have well qualified hardware and gigabit fiber already. 
- Github actions is super cool, outside of code scanning, to build and push your packages to your repos. 
- Figured out Golang more and testing Hugo in order to properly selfhost my blog. The very which you are currently reading! 

Until next week :smiley:
