This month:
- Properly set up my workstation that I built in the last two weeks of March. Properly set up the BIOS for Virtualization, RAM Overclocking, CPU Overclocking. 
- Set up a VM running on the workstation on a bridged network, because I do not have time to try to figure out how to copy and paste from a RDP session into a Virtualbox VM.
