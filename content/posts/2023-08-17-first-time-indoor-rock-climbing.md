A team lead at one of Arc'teryx's newest New York City stores passed along information about an amazing group that meets at indoor rock climbing gyms in the new york city area called the "BIPOC Climbing Collective" on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bipocclimbingcollective/). In lieu of learning how to play Mahjong at the Ace Hotel with Chop Suey Club that evening, my girlfriend and I took the Uptown express to Harlem 125th Street where we walked two blocks to get to The Cliffs at Harlem. The location was very convenient for us via public transit and the gym was located right across the street from the Apollo Theater. 

For the event, the gym offered a discount of fifteen dollars for the entrance pass and seven more dollars for rental shoes and chalk. We signed the safety waiver for The Cliffs, picked up our rentals, and made our way into the gym. I did my homework and looked at the event space on Google Maps to get an understanding beforehand. When I walked into the gym, I was blown away by the intricate rock patterns, different workout and training tools, and of course the tactitude of the climbers. We introduced ourselves to Trevor, the organizer, and he gave us a quick introduction to the space while we sat tight for announcements to come. Everyone went around in a circle and introduced themselves and shared how long they have been climbing and how they found the group. Many people who came that night had mutual friends that introduced them to climbing and thus became friends mutually as well which was cool to see. 

Trevor was able to get us that were new to climbing up and running with the lingo, the way to fall, and how to climb a course. Mia and I did various V0 and V1 level courses that the gym offered, some that were more successful than others. 

The night concluded with day pass raffles, drink raffles, and a shoe raffle. 

Thanks to the Arc'teryx team for letting me know about the event.
