This past week, I was notified by my Girlfriend that the Squishmallows World tour was making a stop in New York City on Sunday October 1st at 34th Street Herald Square, so it was convenient for me to get to. 

We have a lot of Squishmallows at home, so this event was meaningful to me. So because this was the first IRL Squishmallows event that I attended, I was not sure what to expect. 

1. The event ran from 11am to 5pm, but I knew that lots of people were going to line up way earlier for a legendary event such as this one. I personally got there around 3:30 because I knew I was going to see the decorations but not sure if I was doing any activations. 

I get there, there is already an existing line that snakes a good while. Maybe about 150 people in front of me. There was a DJ spinning family friendly danceable pop hits.  

There was this cool cauldron with a lot of Squishmallow clips. 

Different characters on a rotating basis would come out and dance. When I got on line, the cat one was out. When I got closer to the front, the bat came out. 

While I was waiting in line, I saw people already in line with Squishmalllows. I was super unsure if people were bringing the same ones from home or if they were bringing them from some store. But it turned out that they were going through the activations, getting their prize, exiting then getting back in line. 

The line was quick, no forms, no paperwork. You get a little token to drop in the ball cabinet and depending on which bucket your ball lands, you get a ticket that says what size Squishmallow you get to keep. 

My I dropped my token haphazardly and got sent to the bucket along the wall and got a ticket indicating that I won a medium-sized squishmallow. 

When I got to the redemption truck, I was presented with either a Tyree the pandacorn or a bat. I picked the lesser of two evils, so I went home with a pandacorn. 

Bonus: 711 on 34th Street sells Squishmalllows
