When the great migration off of Twitter happened, I jumped to Mastodon to see what is up. Much of the online infosec community has made the jump to the server, ioc.exchange. 

I learned more about ActivityPub, which builds the backbone of communities like Mastodon and Pixelfed.

My first impressions:
- The Drupal community is not dead? Ok not that surprising, but cool to see Drupal thrive like this. 
- A lot of... bird communities. I get the hype and the appeal for the hobby. Nice to see them kicking.   
- I expect much to change as power and people shift across servers. 

Leave the Musk for the Tusk! :mammoth:

As always, one good resource to find servers that caters to certain niches is on the official Mastodon webpage itself
