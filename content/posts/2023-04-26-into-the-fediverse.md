When the great migration off of Twitter happened, I jumped to Mastodon to see what is up. Much of the online infosec community had already made the jump to a couple of mastodon servers. I was surprised to see that some of the domains were already in the threat feeds from some of my vendors! 

I learned more about ActivityPub, which builds the backbone of communities like Mastodon and Pixelfed. 

My impressions so far are summed up like so:
- The Drupal community is not dead??? Ok not that surprising, but cool to see the Drupal community show up early in my searching. 
- There are a lot of... bird communities, and there forth bird watching servers. 
- I expect that there would be some kind of power struggle in terms of which servers will market themselves to be more reliable and responsive over other ones. As well as the forecasted shift from Web2 to something new.

Leave the Musk for the Tusk! :mammoth:

## Interesting Mastodon Servers 

Here is a list of interesting Mastodon servers that I have found during my search:

| Server link | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
|  mastodon.social   | the OG space         |
|  opencoaster.net   | "A community of theme park enthusiasts. We like coasters, themed attractions, churros and everything else related."          |
|  mountains.social  | Mastodon instance focusing on hiking, mountaineering, climbing, backpacking and the outdoors.          |
|  masto.nyc         | Regional New York City üêò üóΩ instance!        |
|  toot.pizza        | An NYC-based instance geared towards transit/urbanism/politics nerds.          |
|  peoplemaking.games |  We're a community of folks who celebrate the craft of creating interactive experiences, whether they're working in games or around them! This is a space for games folks and creatives to call home!           |
|  urbanists.social  |  We're a server for people who like bikes, transit, and walkable cities. Let's get to know each other!         |
|  defcon.social     |  My first Mastodon server that I signed up with. So it deserves a spot on the list. |

As always, one good resource to find servers that cater to certain niches is on the official Mastodon webpage itself
