It was a slow week this week. Mostly just accumulating, documenting, and accessing inventory. 

Notable things:
- Figuring out to implement more features from the PaperMod's demostration site onto this very site. No luck with favicons, but that isn't a hard stop. 
- Setting up proper inventory of all the assets and miscellaneous accessories (drives, memory modules, etc)
- Set up one of my Optiplex boxes, named wafflesbox, with upgraded memory modules and Ubuntu server loaded. It wasn't a perfect install because the Windows Bootloader actually occupies a portion of the drive. The full SSD was not properly utilized by the Ubuntu install. 
- Replaced the deployed Raspberry Pi and its running services with the mentioned Optiplex. The biggest constraints right now is space and heat, so the raspberry pi had to go. 
 

# Questions on my mind:
- How to implement ethernet level speeds and reliability without using a really long ethernet cable?
- Doing more homework about a true privacy focused VPN purchase. The only blocker currently is cost and how important it is to start a monthly subscription now (travel, professional life, and personal life come in play here).
- Think about a clean cooling solution for the current state of the lab.
