This month was a slow and hot one. The circuit breaker for the air conditioning unit tripped twice, and the facilities people reset all the circuit breakers in the apartment so the power to my NAS and Optiplexes got cut out. I went on BH Photo and bought a used open box pristine Vertiv Liebert uninterruptible power supply. 

Besides the hardware addition, I realized that the first time the power went out, the DNS table on the router became corrupted somehow and shuffled the entries on the table. I couldn't resolve the issue unless I physically was inside the network to access the admin console of the router to fix the DNS entry.
