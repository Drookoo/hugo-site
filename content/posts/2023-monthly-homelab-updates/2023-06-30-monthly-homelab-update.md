This month was a fairly quiet month for the one bedroom studio datacenter in the heart of Manhattan. For this month: 
- I continued to study for my SANS GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware Exam. Hopefully I can say with confidence that I have passed.
- I deployed [Immich, a high performance self-hosted photo and video backup solution](https://github.com/immich-app/immich). One of the painpoints that I'm suspecting is that I've been putting square blocks inside circle holes. When I'm shooting photos, instead of sharing images through Flickr, something that Lychee is a self-hosted alternative to, no one in the real world is downloading images through Flickr. What is more commonly used around the running communities is Dropbox and/or Google Photos. I should have been sharing my photos through alternatives to the aforementioned services rather than trying to fit Flickr in a Dropbox shaped hole.
