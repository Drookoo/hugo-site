This month was a fairly quiet month for the one bedroom studio datacenter in the heart of Manhattan. For this month: 
- I started studying for my SANS GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware Exam. 
- I reorganized the folder and directory structure of this blog site. To practice good hygiene and reduce the amount of content-debt, I had to ensure that I knew how Hugo handled nested files, nested folders, and images.
