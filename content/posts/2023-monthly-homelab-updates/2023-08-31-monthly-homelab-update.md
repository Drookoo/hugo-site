This month was a blur. 

I also figured out to allow Google's site crawling for this blog site. I also got Google Analytics connected, so I hope that use comes out of it.

You may notice that this blog is now on my subdomain. I have decided that it was probably better to have my photo portfolio on my main domain instead. 

Remember that Vertiv Liebert UPS I bought last month? I finally installed it. I now regret it because I intentionally bought it for its battery and USB connectivity. But it's USB connectivity compatibility is only configurable through a Windows program. 

I also switched the domain name servers for this domain from Google to Cloudflare. I have heard about Cloudflare tunnels in passing, and finally decided to try it. I was very surprised to see that there was a free tier available. 

I also spent some time this month to investigate if there was a good, cheap, and reliable cloud hosting provider that I can back up all of my storage up to. The Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive option caught my eye because of its ridiculously low cost, but the process was not intuitive, and I might push this venture off until I find time to learn aws-cli or if Google Cloud offers something similar. 

My RSS Feed aggregator broke, and I wasn't able to debug the database issue. So I switched from FreshRSS to Miniflux. I will eventually jump back. I think. 

I was dragging my feet with installing the Vertiv UPS. My lights started flickering during an end of summer heat wave, so I quickly turned off all of my computing technologies. Lo and behold there was a brownout, not because of strain on the grid but because of an underground fire. The only thing that didn't make it out was a board game accessory that I was 3D printing. 

Onto the next one.
