## Preface
I just watched the Barbie (2023) movie at my local AMC theater about a week after opening weekend. My girlfriend decided that we should go watch it after coming home from work one day, so we did. 

When we got there, the theater was packed with movie goers on a Thursday 9:30pm evening. It seemed like every auditorium was showing something, and there was a thirty-person line at the concession stand. There were about less than five staff members actually working the event venue, which became a problem because as we walked into the auditorium to our seats, we realized that there were people already sitting there. It took about ten minutes to find a staff member to remediate the issue which resulted to four people playing musical chairs in the row that our seats were in. 

## The Movie
- The first few scenes of the movie really seems like one giant advertisement. There was very little context on why things were the way they were, until the plot started to roll. 

- One thing that I couldn't wrap my head around was why was there an Asian Ken, but no Asian Barbie. There was evidence that there was in the beginning where they showed off how many ethnicities and professions they made the Barbie into. 

- I appreciated how the finance nerd in me got a little excited when the topic of Treasury bills, bonds, and Certificate of Deposits came up briefly in the movie. 

The Chillies fan in me also go very excited when you see Will Ferrell at the helm of the boardroom holding a pair of two drumsticks, presumably because of his resemblance to his real life doppelg√§nger Chad Smith (who plays the drums for the Chillies).
