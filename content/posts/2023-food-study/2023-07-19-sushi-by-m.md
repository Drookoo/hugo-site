On July 19, 2023 my SO and I tried a new to us omakase restaurant in the east village called `Sushi By M`. It was a special occasion and I did my homework trying to find out which of the numerous omakase restaurants should I take my SO to. I decided to land on this one because of its availability and its price. There were two menus to choose from and various extras that you could order as well. The menu that I predetermined to consume that night was the seventeen piece ($100) course meal listed as follows
1. Kumamoto oyster
2. Hamachi // Yellowtail
3. Kanpachi // Amberjack
4. Akamizuke // Tuna
5. Madai // Red Snapper
6. Chu Toro with Truffle
7. Boton Ebi // Spotted Prawn
8. Shiro Ebi with Sturgeon Caviar
9. Seasonal Item
10. Hotate // Scallop
11. Shima Aji // Stripped Jack
12. King Salsom // New Zealand Salmon
13. Hokkaido Uni // Sea Urchin
14. Toro Caviar
15. Albacore Tuna
16. A5 Wagyu Beef with Uni and Foie Gras
17. BBQ EEl Avocado 


The rice was very seasoned and powerful, we had two beers: Kawaba Snow Weizen and Kawaba Sunrise Ale. The dishes that stood out to me the most were the Sea Urchin, Tuna dish.
