My girlfriend bought me a variety of Running Gels from the Fleet Feet store near our apartment for the holidays so I can use them when I run timed races, and bike long routes. So this post is solely for me to track and review the gels that I've consumed.   

# GU Roctane Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review |
| -----  | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Vanilla Orange | 2022-12-30 | Yes | Run | This was my first gel ever. I took this shortly after mile 6 in a 13 mile run. This tasted very vile. The caffeine added was nice to have, but swallowing the gel was an excruciating experience. At that time I wish I had more after my body spent it. I probably should have intaked water after consumption.|

# GU Original Energy Gels
| Flavor | Date Consumed | Caffeine? | Sport | Review | 
| ------ | ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Strawberry Banana | 2023-01-29 | No | Run | My second gel. This time I decided to pick a flavor without any caffeine. I took this shortly after mile 7 in a 15 mile run, butI didn't intake any water until mile 10/11. The taste was fine, it tasted exactly like strawberries and bananas albiet a little thick when held in my mouth. I squeezed out every last drop and wished there was more. I didn't feel any benefit, short or prolonged, without the caffeine. |
