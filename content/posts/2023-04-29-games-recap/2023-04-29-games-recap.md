# Abstract
Inspired by reading [Branching Paths: A Life in Games](https://muditaheart.itch.io/branching-paths-a-life-in-games) by `@muditaheart`, and looking back at some of my YouTube videos where it's been almost a decade since I started [playing League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8WJ4AI7Dwo), I've decided that there should be a post dedicated to games. 

# Windows 95 // Windows XP
- I remember I had either a Windows 95 or Windows XP Laptop. It had Solitaire and Chess, `3D Pinball for Windows â€“ Space Cadet`, and `Hover!`

# Gameboy SP - NES edition
Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda
Pokemon Fire Red
Final Fantasy IV?

# Ninendo DSi 
Pokemon Diamond, Nintendogs, Cooking mama
Wario ware
Final Fantasy 3

# PSVita 
Marvel vs Capcom, Viewtiful Joe, Phoenix wright 

# Windows Vista
- I think the only game that I remember playing was Chess Titans, Purple Place, Inkball, Solitaire, FreeCell, and Inkball. 
- I then got hold of Starcraft 2, and `Civilization IV: The Complete Edition` which included Warlords, Beyond the Sword, and Colonization. 

# Flash games:
- Runescape, Pokemon Crater, the run of the mill stuff that you would go to the library to get your 40 minutes of computer time each day. to go on flash game aggregator sites. 

- Fast forward to the windows Vista. I believe that Chess came default on that one. 

In either fifth or sixth grade, our humanities teacher brought in a guest speaker. Her name was Yang Shan, and she gave a talk about her experience making games. She demoed a few games to us and I felt very inspired to play more games!

# Steam 
My first dive into Steam that I can remember was: `Sep 18, 2011	Learning with Portals`
But I must have used steam to play other games, ofc F2P, because my steam account was created late June
