This post is a part of series of posts called "A Part of Me", or APoM for short, meant to document my upbringing with various subject matters that matter the most with me present day. These topics and hobbies define who I am, and subsequently have proven to stand the test of time. To not lose any of this to the trials and trepidation of time, they will be eternalized on my blog site until I do something else with them, maybe video based supplements in the future.

This is my second post that goes more in depth about my upbringing.

# First contact 
I had one of my cousins live with me for a while after they had graduated from University of Connecticut. They were new to the New York City and to save time, money and the hassle of moving, they home based out of my childhood home. This is important because this was my first exposure to finance. So when my cousin explained that stocks were just parts of a company that you can own, and therefore be an owner of the company. This is a very difficult concept to wrap my head around, because I was probably a little older than ten years old. I attribute this core memory to my first exposure with finance. 

Fast-forward to present day, I don't work in the financial world. My exposure outside to finance was going to a university with strong business programs. Now how did I get into equities, exchange traded funds, fixed income bonds, and options? Well it's because of a small startup called Robinhood. 

# Robinhood: The First Step 
Robinhood in 2017 was revolutionary. It was marketed as the first brokerage to not charge commission fees for trades. Around this time period, I recall that paying $75 was the norm in some brokerages to place an order. The financial industry was moving towards the future of a low cost anybody can do it type mentality. With the push in funds with low expense ratios, no to little commissions, and the ability to easily buy fractional shares meant that college kids could get in.

I was nineteen, starting my second semester freshmen year, and decided to buy 15 shares of AMD @ $15.18. A day later, I was buying JNUG, a triple leverage gold mining exchange traded fund, because of something I read off of [/r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets). I had zero experience of trading stocks, and had no idea what a triple leveraged ETF was, but thanks to Robinhood, I was trading with no fees. I was referring friends to the platform, because both you and your friend could get free shares of stock once they signed up, and making trades in no time. The free stock that I received from referring my first friend was `$CHK`. 

Looking back my blunders was selling. I sold `$AMD` at a lost, I sold `$CHK` for a handful of dollars, and I was paperhanding `Netflix`. 
Though after the Gamestop blunder, I switched to Fidelity. My core holdings in Microsoft and Visa left Robinhood with me. 

# Stockpile 
This was an interesting platform. Where you could buy units of stock for one dollar. I don't really recall how I got onboarded onto this platform, but it must've been some kind of promotion where you got some free credits that you could redeem for units of stocks. The earliest transaction on this platform was recorded on `December 18, 2017` and I didn't leave until `Jul 13, 2019` 

# Vanguard
I joined Vanguard because of their low expense ratio ETFs. This was before the introduction of Fidelity's FZROX zero expense ratio ETFs. This alongside the boglehead morningstar "Stay the Course" mentality meant that this was the perfect place to park my Roth IRA. I knew the UI was bad and for years I dissuaded my peers from onboarding onto the platform because I knew that they weren't the ones to appreciate dinosaur technology. I signed up on `10/23/2017` and bought my first share of `$VTI` the next day later.
